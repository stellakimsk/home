					<br><br>Oil paints were first used in Western Afghanistan to decorate shields and other objects between the 5th & 9th century. It wasnâ€™t until much later that oil paints were used for artistic purposes. <br><br><br>

				<p>
					<br>The use of oil paints in European art started in the 15th century. In the 16th century, artists started using canvas instead of wood, which held paint pigment better. It also decayed a lot slower than wood, so most of the art pieces left intact as of now were painted on canvas. <br><br><br><br><br>

				<p>
					<br><br>In 1845, zinc replaced lead in the production, making it less toxic. It was only in 1841 that oil paints were produced in metal tubes, premixed and ready immediately. This made it easier for artists to paint outdoors as before, artists had to grind and mix their own paint.
