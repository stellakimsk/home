<!-- Some nice information on oil paint-->
				<p>
					Most of the world’s most famous pieces were created using oil paints. Oil paint is an air-dry paint that dries when exposed to air for a long time. The most common oil used is linseed oil. Oil paint is usually applied on canvas with small strokes, where its slow drying qualities allow the painter to blend different colours together easily. But, because of this, putting light colours over dark is harder than with acrylic, and it is generally assumed that when using oils, you have to be extra careful to not paint over light spots in the art piece. Sometimes being toxic and overall hard to use, oil painting is not recommended for beginners.
