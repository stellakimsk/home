					<br><br>WIth different parts of the world creating pigments for paintings, they acquired unique styles. Chinese watercolorists have used the medium since as early as 4,000BC. They used the watercolour pigments as ink for calligraphy and minimalistic paintings. Watercolour became the standard paint for all of their artworks for millennia. Countries like Japan used it as well, and used silk-like paper to paint it on.   <br>

					<br>Watercolour is one of the oldest paint mediums. Prehistoric artists used watercolour to paint images of nature from 15,000 to 10,000 B.C. It was made by mixing pigments with animal fat or spit. Prehistoric Egypt replaced those with regular water. They are responsible for creating the first man-made pigment around the year 4,500 BC.  <br><br><br><br><br>

					<br><br>Through the Middle Ages, as the manuscripts got more respected, their general aesthetic and visual style was very important. The Book of Kells is one of the most famous manuscripts. In European culture, while oil paintings remained the most used art medium around the early 20th century, watercolour works slowly grew their influence.
